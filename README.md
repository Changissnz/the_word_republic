# What is Republic?

- Plato's Republic is a representative democracy.
- The word "republic" is a portmandeau of "re" (repeat,repetitive) and "public".
  So it makes sense to say that the "republic" is a reversioning, a representation
  of all of the public.
- The concept of the republic can take many forms in real life.
- Personal opinion: the most insane fictional republic is the Galactic Republic of Star Wars.
- It is difficult for some to navigate the republic during good times, and difficult for
  most to navigate the republic during harsh times.
- What should a person expect if they move from one republic to another, and those two republics
  are intensely competing with each other?
- How do legacy and novelty thrive in the republic?
- The republic is probably the most efficient form of governance, based on the labor requirements
  of a society.
- The concept and enactment of the republic cannot be understood with a high degree of confidence
  until old age.
- The republic promotes structure and rigid forms of thinking in the official context.
- The representative nature of the republic means that things are best understood through
  exemplification, even outside of the context of politics.
- The republic enables concentration of values into the few. So the republic upholds some
  forms of exclusivity.
- The republic promotes discipline and unitary belief to uphold its own survival, but also
  is not foolproof to duplicity and circular reasoning.
- The republic would rather turn conservative under conservative leadership, and liberal
  under liberal leadership. The republic would still call itself the republic under conservative
  or liberal leadership if it wanted to be seen that way.
- The republic chooses to spark outrage through its representatives if it is the will of the
  representatives.
- The republic chooses to be a defender of its values through offensive means if the representatives,
  with the backing of their supporters, manage to do so.
- The republic is made up of people, and it is the collection of their beliefs and values that
  ultimately determine how the republic can be generalized.
- The republic is not foolproof to insanity, poor financial decisions, nonsensical theater,
  aimlessness, and mismanagement. It is not an impenetrable machine.
- The republic can be generalized as so and so, but act this and that, and the populace
  can be very perplexed by themselves and confuse others.
- The republic can be described by its institutions, but can only be fully understood by
  understanding the masses and the individual. Understanding the republic is a terribly
  daunting task.
- The republic promotes Darwinian competition through both standardized and non-standardized
  means.
- The republic is always keen on judging what things are the standards, and what things are not,
  during its best or worst of times.
- The republic is a term used by some nations to describe their form of governance.
